% payoff matrix
% constructed after 4 Principles
% 1. Higher than chance performance should be rewarded
% 2. Detection of correct and incorrect decisions should be rewarded
% -> Difference in proportion of using 3 wagers for correct vs. incorrect trials
% 3. Non-discriminative risky behavior will be counteracted by a long timeout
% 4. Difference between I don't know and I made an error (for not rational subjects which are influenced by loss aversion)
